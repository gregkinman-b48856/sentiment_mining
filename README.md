Sentiment Mining
===

This is the repository for the text mining phase of the sentiment analysis project at Freescale. The first phase of the project can be found at [this repository](https://github.com/gregkinman-b48856/sentiment_analysis).

Most of the analysis is done in R, with the `tm` package being the main tool, although some plotting is done in Python using matplotlib.
