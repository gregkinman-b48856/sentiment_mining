"hi stephen   I guess you are asking on how to build uboot for riotboard. below commands  will help you:
  git clone git://github.com/embest-tech/fsl-linaro-toolchain.git
  git clone git://github.com/embest-tech/u-boot-imx.git -b embest_imx_3.0.35_4.0.0
 
  cd u-boot-imx/
  export ARCH=arm
  export CROSS_COMPILE=~/fsl-linaro-toolchain/bin/arm-fsl-linux-gnueabi-
  make distclean
  make mx6solo_RIoTboard_config
  make
 you will get a ""u-boot.bin"" after the build. the  usermanual (p48) shows exactly how to build uboot from an official source. ",http://www.element14.com/community/thread/32447?start=60&tstart=0,28,4,2014,1121

"Hello happy reviewers !I received my kit yesterday (my neighbour got it for me ! ).The small board is great and use 3 main components : a freescale µC, a FTDI serial to USB bridge and a sensor mounted on a small daughter board.This is great because you can reuse the sensor module for your application !I launched the install easily (still being with XP pro 32bit ;-))I tested the different demos for tilt and shake detection but the one i prefered was the scope.For this demo you firstly got to calibrate the sensor by putting it on the table and just press a button. After that you got a scope showing X,Y,Z and some other threshold information for the axis.I am interested because I want to develop someting like a game (snake...), and use X,Y, Z values to move on a small display...For sure I plan to reuse the sensor module because the sensor itself seems impossible to be soldered by hand !I had a look on the CD and no source code, it's a shame !

"The Tower System is a uniquely powerful modular development platform that offers endless possibilities for prototyping a microcontroller-based system.Interchangeable and reusable modules along with open source design files make it easy to customize your design and reduce low level design giving you more time to focus on differentiated solutions. Freescale's modular development platform saves you months of development time now and in the future through rapid prototyping and tool re–use.Take your design to the next level with the Freescale Tower System.Sold in kits or as individual modules, the expansion of your Tower System from a development tool into a development platform is simple and cost effective.
